									<p style="text-align: justify;">As a Data Analyst/Webmaster at the Indiana Department of Insurance, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive Mine Subsidence Database for streamlining claims management. Leveraging technologies like Excel, VBA, Python, and Access, I extracted data from over 7,000 email attachments, performed data cleaning and transformation, and loaded 200,000 rows into an Access database through an ETL pipeline. Additionally, I designed an intuitive Access form-based UI with a SQL backend, enabling users to navigate interactive forms and streamline the claims process efficiently.</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">Exhibiting a commitment to operational excellence, I optimized website maintenance by resolving over 90% of known issues through website analytics tools and standardized content management using Smartsheet forms. Automation played a pivotal role as I automated the organization of 2,000+ enforcement documents into folders, reducing purge time from 2 weeks to 30 minutes. Furthermore, I generated interactive Power BI dashboards visualizing key claims-related KPIs, sourcing data from multiple databases through ETL processes and SQL queries, empowering data-driven decision-making.</p>
